Advancement climate:
- PostgreSQL 9.4+
- JDK 1.8+
Directions for utilizing the driver:
- Add the .container document to your application's classpath
- Utilize the accompanying URL design while interfacing with the data set: jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<database>
- Supplant <host>, <port>, and <database> with the fitting qualities for your current circumstance
- In the event that you are utilizing a PostgreSQL client with a secret key, you will likewise have to supply the client and secret phrase properties:
Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty("user", "<username>");
props.setProperty("password", "<password>");
Association conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<database>", props);

Clarification
The JSONDriver class gives a JDBC driver to interfacing with a PostgreSQL data set and returning results in JSON design. The driver carries out the Driver interface from java.sql.Driver.
The interface() strategy acknowledges a URL in the configuration "jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<database>", as well as a Properties object containing client and secret word data. The technique will return a JSONConnection object, which is a subclass of java.sql.Connection.
The getPropertyInfo() strategy returns a variety of DriverPropertyInfo objects, one for every property that the driver upholds. This data can be utilized by applications to figure out which properties to set while associating with the information base.
The getMajorVersion() and getMinorVersion() techniques return the major and minor form quantities of the driver, individually.
The jdbcCompliant() strategy returns misleading, showing that the driver isn't JDBC consistent.
The JSONDriver class likewise incorporates a primary() technique, which can be utilized to test the driver. This technique acknowledges a URL and a Properties object as contentions, and will print the JSON result of the data set inquiry to the control center.
To utilize the driver, add the .container document to your application's classpath and utilize the URL design "jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<database>". Supplant <host>, <port>, and <database> with the fitting qualities for your current circumstance. In the event that you are utilizing a PostgreSQL client with a secret key, you will likewise have to supply the client and secret phrase properties.
